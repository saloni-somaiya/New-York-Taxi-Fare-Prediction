# New-York-Taxi-Fare-Prediction

This is a playground Kaggle competition on New York City Taxi Fare Prediction with a dataset of 44M rows. 
For better analysis and saving up the memory I have used limited data which are important for prediction. 
Here I am supposed to predict the taxi fare amount (inclusive of tolls) given the pickup and dropoff locations by training various models.

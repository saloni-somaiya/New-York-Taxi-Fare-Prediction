# New-York-Taxi-Fare-Prediction

This is a playground Kaggle competition on New York City Taxi Fare Prediction with a dataset of 44M rows. 
For better analysis and saving up the memory I have used limited data which are important for prediction. 
Here I am supposed to predict the taxi fare amount (inclusive of tolls) given the pickup and dropoff locations by training various models. I have used more features approx. 27 for training the data. Various configurations of neural network were performed and batch normalization for deep learning on 512 dense layers. Also I have tried implementing ensemble modeling and light gradient boosting to achieve the best score and minimum loss.

Models:
1. Linear Regression
2. Random forest Regressor
3. Neural Network
4. Gradient Boosting
